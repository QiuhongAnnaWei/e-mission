This micro webpage is a one-stop tracker and calculator of carbon emission from your food consumption. Based on user input, it is capable of dynamically calculating emission statistics, generating trendlines, and outputing visual quantitative comparison among the user, the average American, and the average global citizen. Through this web app, we hope to raise awareness about the impact we are having on our planet Earth, through actions as simple and essential as eating.
